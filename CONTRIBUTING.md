# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in improving this project!

This repository is licensed under **CC BY-NC-ND 4.0**, which normally doesn’t allow derivative works.  
However, contributions are still if there's a small tweak that you really need to scratch — they just need to be made under the terms of our [Contributor License Agreement](./docs/CLA.md).

However, note that I have a strong vision for where the project is going and often certain features and approaches can go detriment the ability to achieve that vision. So please, feel free to make a tweak for your own use and even submit it as a pull request, but please don't be offended if I don't accept it.

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Create** a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-fix`).
3. **Commit** your changes clearly.
4. **Open a Pull Request** and confirm that you agree to the CLA in the pull request form.

### What Happens Next
- Your PR will be reviewed.
- If accepted, your contribution will be merged and attributed to you in the commit history and/or CONTRIBUTORS file.

By contributing, you’re helping improve the project while Dale de Silva retains full responsibility for its ongoing stewardship and licensing.
